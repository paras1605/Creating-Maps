We are going to create map showing S&P BSE Mumbai office using BSE icon as marker.
```{r}
library(leaflet)
bseIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://origin-beta.bseindia.com/include/images/BSE_LOGO.jpg",
  iconWidth = 40*215/230, iconHeight = 40,
  iconAnchorX = 40*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 20
)
bseSite <- "<a href = 'https://www.bseindia.com/'> BSE Sensex Mumbai </a>"
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lat = 18.929863, lng = 72.833427, icon = bseIcon, popup = bseSite)
my_map
```
